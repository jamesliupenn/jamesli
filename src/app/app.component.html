<p> Hi, this is James Li. I currently work at Oracle (previously Opower, acquired by Oracle in 2016) as an Operations Engineer. I'm a self-taught programmer interested in opportunities as a full-stack developer, hoping to build cool web applications for a living!!! I personally love to work on the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular 4, and Node.js) but am open to learn anything new! </p>
