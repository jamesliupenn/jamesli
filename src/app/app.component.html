<p class="intro"> Hi, this is James Li. I currently work at Oracle (previously Opower, acquired by Oracle in 2016) as an Operations Engineer. I'm a self-taught programmer interested in opportunities as a full-stack developer or a technical solutions engineer, hoping to build cool web applications and make the world a better place!!! I personally love to work on the MEAN stack but am open to learn anything new! </p>
